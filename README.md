## Repository Structure

The repository includes code for both simulation studies and real data analysis as described in the paper.

- [`functions/`](./functions): Contains core methodological functions and helper routines shared by both simulations and real data analysis. A detailed description of the scripts is provided in `functions/functions_readme.md`.
- [`simulation/`](./simulation): Contains scripts to reproduce the simulation experiments in the paper. A detailed description of the scripts is provided in `simulation/simulation_readme.md`.
- [`real data/`](./real%20data): Contains scripts for real data analysis, including preprocessing and inference steps. A detailed description is provided in `real data/economic/economic_readme.md` and `real data/yeast/yeast_readme.md`.
