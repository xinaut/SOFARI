# Functions Folder Description

This folder contains R function files used to support the simulation studies and real data applications.

- `adaptive_thresholding.R`: Implements adaptive thresholding for covariance matrix estimation.
- `func_strongly.R`: Contains functions for computing the debiased test statistic in the **strongly orthogonal** case.
- `func_weakly.R`: Contains functions for computing the debiased test statistic in the **weakly orthogonal** case.
- `functions_helper.R`: Contains functions for generate the simulation settings and implements some basic functions.
- `nodewise_lasso.R`: Computes the precision matrix estimator using the nodewise Lasso procedure.
- `STRS.R`: Computes the rank of the coefficient matrix based on the STRS method.
